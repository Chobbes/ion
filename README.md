# Ion

Ion is heavily experimental.  Don't use it for anything right now.

Ion is a Haskell EDSL that is inspired by another EDSL,
[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom](Atom).  Ion aims to be a
re-implementation of Atom which, rather than generating C code directly (as
Atom does), interfaces with another very powerful, more general EDSL,
[http://ivorylang.org](Ivory).
